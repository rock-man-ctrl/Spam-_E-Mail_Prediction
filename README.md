# Spam-_E-Mail_Prediction
Steps to make a Spam E-Mail Prediction model using Logistic Regression

STEP-1 : Import the following libraries TfidfVectorizer, train_test_split, LogisticRegression, accuracy_score

STEP-2 : Load the dataset from csv file to a pandas Dataframe

STEP-3 : Replace the null values with a null string as they cause misunderstanding or some Errors

STEP-4 : Now label spam mail as 0 and ham mail as 1

STEP-5 : Split the data into training data & test data

STEP-6 : Convert the text data into feature vectors that can be used as input to the Logistic regression

STEP-7 : Convert Y_train and Y_test values as integers for the better understanding

STEP-8 : Train the Logistic Regression model with the training data

STEP-9 : predict the accuracy on training data

STEP-10 : Finally test it with a spam mail input.
